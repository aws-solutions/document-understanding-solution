What is a novel coronavirus?,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identi􀃒ed. The virus causing coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness,
like the common cold."
"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019,
abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease
was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”."
What is the source of the virus COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
people and may di􀃗erent species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can
infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that
causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have
their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely
single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown."
How does the virus spread?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets
produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another
(within about 6 feet)."
Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when
they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or
at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More
recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons."
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not
developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that
disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of
time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from
the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released
from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed
illness during the incubation period."
"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food?","Currently, there is
no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the
virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the
virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from
food products or packaging."
Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?,"Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through
food – additional investigation is needed."
Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature a􀃗ect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that
cause the common cold and 􀃓u, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to
become sick with these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity,
and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."
What is community spread?,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or
where they became infected."
What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?,"Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer
environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based
cuto􀃗 for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the
environment, etc."
Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?,"At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by
mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person."
Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?,"It is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness. If you have a chronic health problem, you may be
at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. "
"Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?","There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most
often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be
spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get
COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."
Is it okay for me to donate blood?,"In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The
need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages
people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able."
What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children
and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date."
Are the symptoms of COVID-19 di􀃗erent in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with con rmed COVID-19 have
generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever,
runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may
be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare
needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
Should children wear masks?,"CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of su􀃗ocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance."
How can my family cope with the added stress?,"Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family’s situation. It is important to continue your family’s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past."
What should I do if someone in my house gets sick with COVID-19?,"Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including: 
• Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
• Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or
sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
• If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash
hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
• Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent
spreading COVID-19 to others.
• Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
• Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks."
How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work?,"Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options"
Should I use soap and water or a hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?,"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?,"People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
People with these symptoms or combinations of symptoms may have COVID-19:
Cough
Shortness of breath or di􀃕culty breathing
Or at least two of these symptoms:
Fever
Chills
Repeated shaking with chills
Muscle pain
Headache
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell"
Is it possible to have the 􀃓u and COVID-19 at the same time?,It is possible to test positive for 􀃓u (as well as other respiratory pathogens) and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the same time.
Where can I get tested for COVID-19?,"The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increa"
Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19?,"Using the CDC-developed viral test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person’s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness."
What kind of test is being used to diagnose if I have COVID-19?,"There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency. All of these viral tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples."
What is antibody testing? And can I be tested using this method?,"Antibody testing checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus."
"If I have recovered from COVID-19, will I be immune to it?","CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others."
Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People aged 65 years and older
People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have serious heart conditions
People who are immunocompromised
Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone
marrow or organ transplantation, immune de ciencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of
corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications
People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40)
People with diabetes
People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis
People with liver disease"
What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do?,"If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
Stock up on supplies
Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others
When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick
Limit close contact and wash your hands often
Avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel"
Are there any medications I should avoid taking if I have COVID-19?,"Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID- 19. People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible. Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider."
How do clinicians get access to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing?,"Clinicians can access laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through clinical laboratories
performing tests authorized or intended to be authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform their
diagnostic services to see how best to access SARS-CoV-2 testing.
Clinicians also can access diagnostic testing through their state public health departments. The Association of Public
Health Laboratories (APHL) provides a list of available public health laboratory testing locations.
For a list of COVID-19 EUAs, see FDA’s COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices"
Under what circumstances should laboratories use either a SARS-CoV-2 molecular or serological test that has received EUA from FDA?,"FDA has authorized EUAs for both molecular and serological tests for COVID-19. Molecular tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In contrast, serological tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on molecular tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
However, a negative result from molecular testing does not rule out COVID-19."
Where do laboratories get access to reagents and materials to perform diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2?,"Public health laboratories can access collection materials for SARS-CoV-2 testing, including swabs and transport media,
through the International Reagent Resource (IRR) . The IRR supports state and local public health laboratories, as well
as other quali ed laboratories participating in public health surveillance and studies, by providing reagents, tools, and information for studying SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens."
"an laboratories use specimen collection devices other than those listed in the manufacturer’s instructions or EUA
(e.g., swabs) for SARS-CoV-2 testing?","According to FDA, when one entity establishes equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens
with the new and original components (including viral transport media [VTM]), and FDA’s review of the validation data
indicates that it could be applicable to modi cations of other tests with an authorized EUA, FDA will post this information
on its website so that other laboratories can refer to the validation for their testing. Then, other laboratories do not need
to conduct their own bridging study for the same modi cation."
My facility would like to begin SARS-CoV-2 testing. Do we need a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certi cate? Can my facility be granted a waiver from the CLIA certi cation requirements so that I can begin testing immediately?,"Before conducting SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, a laboratory must be CLIA-certi ed and meet applicable regulatory
requirements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have the authority to grant waivers of
exceptions that are not established in a statute or regulation."
"When FDA authorizes emergency use for a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test, can that test be used in CLIA certi cate-ofwaiver
facilities?","When the FDA grants an EUA for a point-of-care test, that test is deemed to be CLIA-waived. For the duration of the
national emergency declaration for COVID-19, such tests can be performed in any CLIA-certi ed patient care setting with
a certi cate of waiver."
Does CDC require all laboratories to report test results directly to CDC?,"No. CDC is working with state health departments to collect SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing data that they already receive from most clinical laboratories. Data will be collected from state health departments in two phases: Data will be
aggregated by county or ZIP code, then states will send de-identi ed test-level data using electronic HL7 reporting or CSV les. CDC also receives SARS-CoV-2 testing data directly from state and local public health laboratories, a few large
commercial laboratories, and its own laboratories"
Who is authorized to receive laboratory testing data?,"According to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act , or CARES Act, the Secretary of Health and
Human Services is authorized to receive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing data. CDC is one of several agencies of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). As a result, both HHS and CDC have requested testing data from
laboratories. These data will help the public health response understand the number of tests ordered and performed,
results of each test, and the percent positive."
Where do test developers get the genomic RNA needed to validate test performance for FDA?,"Currently, genomic RNA material can be used for validation purposes in biosafety level 2 laboratories (BSL-2). Genomic
RNA material is available through BEI Resources . Registration with BEI Resources is required to request SARSCoV-
2 materials. BEI Resources is prioritizing and fast-tracking all SARS-CoV-2 registrations with a 12- to 72-hour
turnaround time for all SARS-CoV-2-related registrations. Please contact BEI Resources at contact@beiresources.org or
1-800 359-7370 for questions."
What supplies is IRR distributing for SARS-CoV-2 testing?,"The catalog of COVID-19 diagnostic supplies includes:
Sample collection kits, to swab the nasopharynx, nose, and throat
Extraction kits, to isolate the viral genetic material (RNA)
Test kits, to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2
Ancillary supplies required to perform certain commercial tests"
"I am a HCP living with someone who is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. What precautions should I
take?","Take the same precautions recommended for people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. There are no
additional precautions for HCP. Some HCP may choose to implement extra measures when arriving home from providing
healthcare, such as removing any clothing worn during delivery of healthcare, taking o􀃗 shoes, washing clothing, and
immediately showering. How"
Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19?,"Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow risk assessment and infection control guidelines for HCP exposed to
patients with suspected or con􀃒rmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices
is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited;
facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with con􀃒rmed or suspected COVID-19,
especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on sta􀃕ng availability."
When is someone infectious?,"The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible
that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to
infections with MERS CoV and SARS CoV However detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of symptoms) and presymptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in
transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to
development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2–14 days."
Which body 􀃓uids can spread infection?,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been
isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage 􀃓uid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in
blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients,
including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper
and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or
longer. Duration of several week or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable,
infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV
has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body 􀃓uids
from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2."
Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2?,"The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Patients with
MERS-CoV are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune
protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19."
How do you test a patient for infection with SARS-CoV-2?,"Clinicians are able to access laboratory testing through state and local public health laboratories, as well as
commercial and clinical laboratories across the country. The Association of Public Health Laboratories provides a
list of states and territories with laboratories that are using COVID-19 viral tests. For more information, see Testing in
U.S. Clinicians should direct testing questions to their state health departments. Commercial reference laboratories
are also able to o􀃗er a larger volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.
CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health
departments and/or individual clinicians.
Healthcare providers should report positive results to their local/state health department CDC does not directly
collect these data directly.
See recommendations for prioritization of testing, and instructions for specimen collection at Evaluating and Testing
Persons for COVID-19."
Do existing commercially available multiple respiratory virus panels detect SARS-CoV-2?,"Yes. There are commercially developed respiratory panels with multi-pathogen molecular assays that can detect
respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, in􀃓uenza, and other human coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory
illness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains a list of tests that includes viral tests with Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA)."
"If a patient tests positive for another respiratory virus, should that exclude SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of illnes","Patients can be infected with more than one virus at the same time. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses in people
with COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, identifying infection with one respiratory virus does not exclude SARS-CoV-
2 virus infection."
Should chest CT be used for diagnosis of COVID-19?,"Clinicians considering use of chest CT scans for diagnosis or management of COVID-19 patients should consider whether
such imaging will change clinical management. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that CT should not
be used to screen for COVID-19, or as a 􀃒rst-line test to diagnose COVID-19, and that CT should be used sparingly and
reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with speci􀃒c clinical"
Whom should healthcare providers notify if they suspect a patient has COVID-19?,"Healthcare providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a
patient. If a patient tests positive, providers should report that positive result to their local/state health department."
Should post-exposure prophylaxis be used for people who may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19?,"There is currently no FDA-approved post-exposure prophylaxis for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. For
information about registered clinical trials of investigational therapeutics for pre or post exposure prophylaxis of SARSCoV-
2 infection, visit ClinicalTrials.gov"
How are COVID-19 patients treated?,"Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 is focused on supportive care for complications, including supplemental oxygen and advanced organ support
for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial
etiologies may be warranted.
Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS, due to the potential for
prolonging viral replication, as has been observed with MERS coronavirus and in􀃓uenza. Corticosteroids should be
avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g., COPD exacerbation or refractory septic shock following the
Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines ).
For information on investigational therapies, see Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19."
Do patients with con􀃒rmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be admitted to the hospital?,"Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical
management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate isolation precautions.
Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor
these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend
not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe
isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. For more information, see Interim
Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Con􀃒rmed Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting and Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring
Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
When can patients with con rmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital?,"Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Isolation should be maintained at
home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital Transmission-
Based Precautions.
Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in
consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health authorities based upon
multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 in
respiratory specimens."
"If I have patients with asthma, do I need to make any changes to their daily asthma preventive management
regimens to reduce their risk of getting sick with COVID-19?","People with moderate to severe asthma, particularly if not well controlled, might be at higher risk of getting very sick from
COVID-19."
"If my patient experiences an asthma exacerbation, should the exacerbation be treated any di􀃗erently to reduce risk
of COVID-19?","Selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma exacerbations has not been
a􀃗ected by what we currently know about COVID-19.
Systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat an asthma exacerbation per national asthma guidelines and current
standards of care, even if it is caused by COVID-19. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids to treat asthma
exacerbations should be continued. There is currently no evidence to suggest that short-term use of systemic
corticosteroids to treat asthma exacerbations increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19, whereas there is an
abundance of data to support use of systemic steroids for moderate or severe asthma exacerbations."
"What do waste management companies need to know about wastewater and sewage coming from a healthcare
facility or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or person under investigation (PUI)?","Waste generated in the care of PUIs or patients with con􀃒rmed COVID-19 does not present additional considerations for
wastewater disinfection in the United States. Coronaviruses are susceptible to the same disinfection conditions in
community and healthcare settings as other viruses, so current disinfection conditions in wastewater treatment facilities
are expected to be su􀃕cient. This includes conditions for practices such as oxidation with hypochlorite (i.e., chlorine
bleach) and peracetic acid, as well as inactivation using UV irradiation"
"Do wastewater and sewage workers need any additional protection when handling untreated waste from healthcare
or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or PUI?","Wastewater workers should use standard practices including basic hygiene precautions and wear the recommended
PPE as prescribed for their current work tasks when handling untreated waste. There is no evidence to suggest that
employees of wastewater plants need any additional protections in relation to COVID-19."
What is the di􀃗erence between cleaning and disinfecting?,"Cleaning with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection.
Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading
infection."
Does CDC recommend use of facemasks or respirators for healthcare personnel (HCP) caring for pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection?,"When available, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be
used for the care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, including women who are pregnant. For more
information, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or
Con rmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings."
Do all patients with con􀃒rmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be placed in airborne infection isolation rooms?,"No. Updated CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Con􀃒rmed
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings recommends placing patients in a regular examination room
with the door closed. Airborne infection isolation rooms should be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol generating
procedures or for diagnoses such as active tuberculosis."
"How long does an examination room need to remain vacant after being occupied by a patient with con􀃒rmed or
suspected COVID-19?","Although spread of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be primarily via respiratory droplets, the contribution of small respirable
particles to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. Airborne transmission from person-to-person over long
distances is unlikely.
The amount of time that the air inside an examination room remains potentially infectious is not known and may depend
on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in
the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an aerosol-generating procedure was performed. Facilities will
need to consider these factors when deciding when the vacated room can be entered by someone who is not wearing
PPE."
"My hospital is experiencing a shortage of isolation gowns. To preserve our supply, can we stop using gowns for the
care of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other endemic multidrug-resistant
organisms (MDROs), and Clostridioides di􀃕cile?","CDC has released information about strategies to optimize the supply of isolation gowns. Healthcare facilities should
refer to that guidance and implement the recommended strategies to optimize their current supply of gowns. This
includes shifting toward the use of washable cloth gowns, if feasible."
What type of gown is recommended for patients with suspected or con􀃒rmed COVID-19?,"Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are
appropriate for use by patients with suspected or con􀃒rmed COVID-19."
What types of gowns are available for healthcare personnel to protect from COVID-19?,"While the transmissibility of COVID-19 is not fully understood, gowns are available that protect against
microorganisms. The choice of gown should be made based on the level of risk of contamination. Certain areas of
surgical and isolation gowns are de􀃒ned as “critical zones” where direct contact with blood, body 􀃓uids, and/or other
potentially infectious materials is most likely to occur."
What is the di􀃗erence between gowns and coveralls?,"Gowns are easier to put on and, in particular, to take o􀃗. They are generally more familiar to healthcare workers and
hence more likely to be used and removed correctly. These factors also facilitate training in their correct use.
Coveralls typically provide 360-degree protection because they are designed to cover the whole body, including the
back and lower legs, and sometimes the head and feet as well. Surgical/isolation gowns do not provide continuous
whole-body protection (e.g., they have possible openings in the back, and typically provide coverage to the mid-calf
only)."
What type of glove is recommended to care for suspected or con􀃒rmed COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings?,"Nonsterile disposable patient examination gloves, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are
appropriate for the care of patients with suspected or con􀃒rmed COVID-19."
"Are extended length gloves necessary when caring for suspected or con􀃒rmed COVID-19 patients in healthcare
settings?","According to CDC Guidance, extended length gloves are not necessary when providing care to suspected or con􀃒rmed
COVID-19 patients. Extended length gloves can be used, but CDC is not speci􀃒cally recommending them at this time."
How do I put on (don) or take o􀃗 (do􀃗) my gloves?,"Check to see if your facility has guidance on how to don and do􀃗 PPE. The procedure to don and do􀃗 should be
tailored to the speci􀃒c type of PPE that you have available at your facility"
Should I wear a respirator in public?,"Most often, spread of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among close contacts (within 6 feet). Recent
studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who
are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue."
What makes N95 respirators di􀃗erent from facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask)?,"N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95
respirators are tight-􀃒tting respirators that 􀃒lter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small
particles."
What is a Surgical N95 respirator and who needs to wear it?,"A surgical N95 (also referred as a medical respirator) is recommended only for use by healthcare personnel (HCP) who
need protection from both airborne and 􀃓uid hazards (e.g., splashes, sprays). These respirators are not used or
needed outside of healthcare settings. In times of shortage, only HCP who are working in a sterile 􀃒eld or who may be
exposed to high velocity splashes, sprays, or splatters of blood or body 􀃓uids should wear these respirators, such as in
operative or procedural settings. Most HCP caring for con􀃒rmed or suspected COVID-19 patients should not need to
use surgical N95 respirators and can use standard N95 respirators."
