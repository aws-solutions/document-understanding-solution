In this track, you can search through multiple documents and find information faster
and more efficiently, using  traditional search based technologies such as Amazon 
Elasticsearch as well using state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language
with Amazon Kendra.

Once you select a document, you'll be able to interact with Amazon Textract,
Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Comprehend Medical to experience the power
of document digitization and extraction of sensitive information.

For demo purposes, we've loaded data related to COVID-19. Ask a question related
to this topic and see the power of natural language search.
